##  About the project

> _In this project is pretty straight forward. I recoded printf function. I learned how to use variadic functions._

	This project consists of coding a library that contains a simplified version of the printf function.



## Usage

### Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile, go to the library path and run:

```shell
$ make
```

**2. Using it in your code**

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "ft_printf.h"
```
